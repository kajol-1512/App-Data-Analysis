# App-Data-Analysis

I loved this project on Dataquest and picked up to work on it using Pandas!

Short Introduction:

What the project is about: As a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, I have to analyze the mobile app data. For example: Which users have seen and engaged them with ads, will help us understand how much revenue the user of our apps determines.

We only build free apps to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that the number of users of our apps determines our revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.

This project aims to analyze data to help our developers understand what apps will likely attract more users on Google Play and the App Store.

To do this: I'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store from Kaggle.

- A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).
- A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).
